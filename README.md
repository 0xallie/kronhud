***This mod is currently in early beta, things may not look/work correctly.***

## Widgets

Currenty KronHUD has: 

- Keystrokes
- ItemUpdates
- Crosshairs
- Ping
- FPS
- CPS
- Potions
- Arrows
- Coordinates

All modules can be moved around freely, and have snapable movement so you can get everything in line!

Colors are customizable too!

More modules are planned to be added. Make sure you add a feature request if you have any ideas!

## To compile

Currently, I am using [PolishAPI](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/Polish) for the UI of this mod. If you want to build this mod you'll have to first build polish and put it into a `./libs/` folder.
