# KronHUD

A mod to add clean and useful HUD widgets.

***This mod is currently in early beta, things may not look/work correctly***

## Widgets

Currenty KronHUD has: 

- Keystrokes
- ItemUpdates
- Crosshairs
- Ping
- FPS
- Cps
- Potions
- Arrows

## To compile

Currently, I am using [PolishAPI](https://github.com/DarkKronicle/Polish) for the UI of this mod. If you want to build this mod you'll have to first build polish and put it into a `./libs/` folder.
