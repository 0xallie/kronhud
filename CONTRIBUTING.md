Styling should be fairly consistent to the rest of the project. As a general rule of thumb:

```
if (false) {
    return true;
}
```

Spaces before/after ()'s and every if statement should have `{}`'s. On top of that curly braces should be same line. Worst case I can fix formatting pretty easily so it's not that big of a deal.

## Comments

Please comment your code so it is easier to tell what it does. That helps every contributor a ton in the long run.

## Customization

Most features should have a decent amount of customization so that clients can toggle features.
